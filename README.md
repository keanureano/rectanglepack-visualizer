# RectPackViz

https://keanureano.github.io/rectanglepack-visualizer/

With ReactJS, potpack, and randomcolor libraries, this visualizer showcases the implementation of a rectangle packing algorithm where you can interactively add and remove boxes, observe their placement within a container, and view useful statistics such as the number of boxes and space utilization percentage. It offers an intuitive way to understand how rectangles can be efficiently packed together.
